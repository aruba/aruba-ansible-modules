## How Can I Contribute?

### Contribution Ideas

1. Raise issues for bugs, features, and enhancements.
1. Submit updates and improvements to the documentation.
1. Submit articles and guides, which are also part of the documentation.

### What should I know before I get started?

The best way to directly collaborate with the project contributors is through GitHub.

* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect, an enhancement request, feature request, or a general issue, please open a GitHub issue.
* If you want to contribute to our code by either fixing a problem, enhancing some code, or creating a new feature, please open a GitHub pull request against the development branch. 
> **Note:** All pull requests require an associated issue number, must be made against the **development** branch, and require acknowledgement of the DCO. See the [Licensing](#licensing) section below.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a GitHub issue, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

It is your responsibility to test and verify, prior to submitting a pull request, that your updated code doesn't introduce any bugs. Please write a clear commit message for each commit. Brief messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes warrant a little more detail (at least a few sentences).
Note that all patches from all contributors get reviewed.
After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If the patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.
When a pull request fails review, the author is expected to update the pull request to address the issue until it passes review and the pull request merges successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches.
